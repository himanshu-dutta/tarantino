Tarantino is a simple ASGI (Asynchronous Web Server Gateway) web framework intended for learning purposes only.

The idea is to cover 70-80% of usecases by building new featues (mostly from scratch) while exploring various alternative solutions to get a better understanding of different concepts used and choices made in more reliable Python web frameworks today.

The package can currently be installed through git directly:

```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/himanshu-dutta/tarantino.git
```

or with one of the two additional sets of dependencies: `test` and `dev`.

```console
$ pip install "tarantino[test] @ git+https://github.com/himanshu-dutta/tarantino.git"
```
